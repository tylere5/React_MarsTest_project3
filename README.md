</strong>My Thoughts</strong>
I found this to be a very difficult project, but very rewarding and insightful. It's hard to grasp how React works, but once you do you
can truly see the advantages it has! Everything appears to be kept very granular and simple. I look forward to digging deeper into React
and using it as a Developer.
